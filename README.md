# menu_bugz

## Another Buggy Flutter project.

### Click the menu and it pops down, as you move the mouse down, the sub menus appear and disappear as normal.

### But click a second time and move the mouse down and now the submenus stay put and they dont disappear as they should.

### Please Un-ban my account from Flutter Github: sgehrman@gmail.com

### Bug Confirmed on Linux and Web, but probably happens on all platforms

### Still need a hotfix for the Web downloading files hang. 3.22.x has been a disaster
